# CI/CD Experiments

Experiments with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub actions, etc.).

## Projects

1. [00 Hello, GitHub Actions](/.github/workflows/00-hello-github-actions.yml) - a proof of concept.

## Lessons learned

- The `.github/workflows` directory must be repository-wide, placed in the root of the Git repo.
  I.e., you can't have multiple `.github` repositories, in sub-folders. You can, however, have
  subfolders inside the `.github/workflows` folder.
